Kayleigh only had five days off over Christmas so we wanted to do a trip that made best use of the time available time. The long range forecast for the West Coast didn't look too bad (for the coast) so we planned on a fast and light trip to Ivory Lake. Unfortunately this plan was thwarted due to slips on the tramping track on the Waitaha, slips on the Totora Valley road, inability to get hold of farmers to gain permission for alternative routes and a worsening forecast. Eric and I had just finished another trip behind Hokitika so we sat in the i-Site in Hoki looking for a plan B, and came up with the idea of heading further south and up the Karangarua to attempt a trip up to Horace Walker Hut in the upper Douglas, over Red Deer Col, down to Christmas Flats and out via the Karangarua. We couldn’t find much beta on the Red Deer Col route apart from a vague Wilderness article that suggested it was possible.

Kayleigh, Christine and Jen met us that evening, and the next morning we headed south.  We parked in the small layby at the south end of the bridge over the Karangarua. The DOC sign at the trailhead featured some pretty big numbers for the places we were going... 35 hours of tramping not including the Red Deer Col crossing!Slower than expected road conditions meant that it was almost midday by the time we started walking.

We headed up along the true right of the river, with the path alternating between terraces and flats. About half an hour in it started drizzling, and this soon gave way to actual rain - not the best start to the trip! After a few kilometres the Karangarua swings to the right leaving the Copland valley heading towards Cassel Flats & Hut. About an hour before the hut we met some trampers on their way out who had just done what we did (but in three days). They told us the Red Deer col route is described in the Aoraki - Te Poutini guidebook.. which we have at home. Luckily they had a photo of the relevant pages on their phone, so we took a photo of the photo on their phone to act as a guide. The wonders of modern technology!

It took around 5 hours to reach Cassel Flats Hut, a nice 6 bunker, which was slightly longer than expected. From here the routes diverge. The tramping route up to the upper Douglas valley heads off up Regina Creek, over a saddle below Conical Hill, then sidles high to reach the upper Douglas. It is possible to just follow the Douglas all the way up, but this sounds horrendous and takes much longer. We passed Cassel Flats hut and headed on for the cableway across the Karangarua. After following the track for a few minutes, the map indicated that we should be level with the cableway, around 100 m to our left. We hunted for a track, but in the absence of anything resorted to bush bashing through dense scrub. When we eventually reached the river the cableway was nowhere to be seen! Turns out it's about 100  m upstream from where marked on the map.

Once we were all safely over the cableway we started up Regina Creek. The track quality from this point drops, although it is still fairly well cut and marked. Immediately after the cable way the track was hard to follow for a short while, but as soon as it started going up became much easier to follow. Around two hours later saw us at the three-wire bridge over Regina Creek. The main cable on this bridge is in need of tightening up, and there are sections at the start and end where there is no net despite a 5 m drop. It was just after 7.30 pm, so we stopped to discuss where to stop for the night. There is a decent camping spot for a couple of tents immediately after the swing bridge, so Eric, Christine and Jen decided to camp there. Kayleigh and I decided to press on for the saddle as we were confident we’d get there well before dark, and quite fancied camping up high and not having to start as early the next morning. The track up to the saddle is steep and exposed, particularly where it crosses slips, and there is a ladder and chain in the upper section. As we climbed dup we were rewarded by the mist clearing, revealing views of the upper Regina, then later down into the Douglas gorge and to snowy peaks beyond; the back of Mt Sefton. We arrived at the saddle about 45 minutes before dark, and dropped down to find a reasonable campsite near to the tarn.

The next morning the others arrived up the hill at about 10 am, and we set off climbing up the ridge to the 1400 m contour where the sidle begins. It started raining just as we were packing ip our camp, and the mist came down. These conditions remained for the rest of the day, with the visibility sometimes as low as a few metres. This made the long sidle quite tricky as it is only sparsely marked with poles. The sidle passes over tussock slopes high above the Douglas river, and would be easy going apart from the numerous deep ravines that have been crossed. In the mist this required a lot of hunting around for a suitable place to cross. We all got pretty damp, cold and tired, and were relieved when it was finally time to drop down to the valley. The route follows a rough spur down onto the top of a morraine wall in the upper Douglas. As we dropped we soon came out of the mist and had good views of the valley below. From the valley floor the map indicates that the route is no longer marked, but to our surprise there was a marked and recently cut 2 m wide highway through the scrub. This made the last two kilometres to the hut a breeze, and we soon arrived at the final obstacle - crossing the river that drains the Horace Walker Glacier. We had been a bit worried about this, but luckily it wasn’t too bad. Thankfully the hut was unoccupied (it’s popular with fly-in hunters) and the five of us managed to squeeze into the four bunks.

The next day was forecast for heavy rain so we opted for a hut day, which I think all of us quite welcomed! In the morning we trudged up to the lake at the top of the valley in the rain, and could just about make out the snout of the Douglas Glacier through the mist. There is a route along the side of the lake to Harpers Big, but it didn’t look very appealing! The afternoon slipped by quickly with a mix of napping, reading and eating.

The rain stopped just before nightfall, and the next morning we were greeted with patchy blue sky and sunshine, although with frost on the ground which felt very Christmassy to us northern hemispherers. We decided to have a go at Red Deer Col. We crossed the Douglas river at the bottom of the flats below the hut. We elected to cross in pairs due to the presence of boulders, and it wasn’t nearly as bad as it looked. We headed up a small stream onto a tussock mound. The first hundred metres or so vertical was pretty horrific bush bashing, especially given the frost, but it soon thinned out to tussock and we climbed the remaining 500 m to the col in the sunshine on ramps winding between bluffs. Fantastic views of the west side of Mt Sefton and the Sierra Range, although we didn’t get a clear view of the summit. It felt odd to think that we were closer to Mueller Hut than the roadend!

At the col we were greeted with mist blowing up from the far side - no view of Christmas Flats! The first 30 m of descent from the col was the crux of the trip - steep loose shale with no handholds. Luckily we had brought ice axes, and although there was little snow we could use the axes to dig into the loose rock. After this it got less steep, and the scree soon gave way to tussock and we descended a spur between Baking Oven Creek and Driver Creek. From the start of the scrub a few key words were missing from our route description photo, so we weren’t sure whether it said to follow the TR branch of Baking Oven Creek to avoid difficulties, or not to follow it. We elected to follow it, which gave easy going for the first 100 m, but then we had to cut back into the scrub to avoid some waterfalls, and quickly found us in dense scrub very close to some steep bluffs. We made it to the flats eventually, watched by some hunters sitting on a clear slope of the opposite side of Baking Oven Creek. From the bottom it looked like anywhere on the TR of Baking Oven Creek mould require passing through a dense band of scrub so I don’t think our route was too bad. Descending on the TL of Baking Oven Creek would avoid the scrub bash, but I’m not sure you could get there from Red Deer Col without some dodgy ravine crossings at the top. In total it took 7 hours from Horace Walker Hut to Christmas Flats.

Luckily we weren’t planning on staying at Christmas Huts as the hut was fully occupied by the hunters, and there was a large stack of crates of DB Brown sitting outside! Kayleigh and I needed to be back in Christchurch by Sunday so decided to press on so we wouldn’t be too late out the next day. The track from Christmas Flats to Cassel Flats is well cut and marked aside from a few slips and windfalls, but these were all short and easily passed. It took us about 5.5 hours back to Cassel Flats, with some fantastic waterfalls and mountain streams en-route. There was another group at Cassel Flats on their way in to do something similar to what we did, so we gave them some route advice. before dropping quickly off to sleep after a 12.5 hour day! Th next morning was sunny and mainly clear, and we were back the the roadend just after mid-day.

All in all a fantastic trip, although would have been even better with better weather and some views. The upper Douglas is very interesting country with access to some interesting peaks as well as to the headwaters of the Landsborough, so I’m sure we’ll be back some day!
